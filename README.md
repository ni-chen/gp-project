Hologram is $I(r) = |R _z(r) + u _z(r)| ^2$ where $u _z(r) = \int _{z _1} ^{z _2} o(r, z) \otimes h _0(r, z) dz$ and $\otimes$ denotes convolution.

In compressive holography, we have linear approximation of

$$
I(r) = | r _z(r) | ^2 - 2 \Re \{ u _z(r) \} + | u _z(r) | ^2 \approx 1- 2 \Re \{ u _z(r) \overline{r _z (r) } \}
$$

which assume that the power of the reference illumination is much more stronger than the object beam, i.e., the objects hinders only a little light. For opacity objects, this means that the objects are sparse (particles or 2D objects with transparent background).
