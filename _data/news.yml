  summary: "With the fast development of computational powers, 3D/4D imaging and display techniques are evolving rapidly. Current research works have made exciting progress, with multiple scientific and engineering applications being demonstrated, including in the fields of holographic imaging & display, Fourier ptychography, optical diffraction tomography, and light field microscopy. These new developments thrived due to a more compact and low-budget optical hardware, as well as advanced computational post-processing methods for enhanced performance, urging new ideas and methods to be exploited.

  summary: "Digital inline holography is an amazingly simple and effective approach for three-dimensional imaging, to which particle tracking velocimetry is of particular interest. Conventional digital holographic particle tracking velocimetry techniques are computationally separated in particle and flow reconstruction, plus the expensive computations. Usually, the particle volumes are recovered firstly, from which fluid flows are computed. Without iterative reconstructions, This sequential space-time process lacks accuracy. This paper presents a joint optimization framework for digital holographic particle tracking velocimetry: particle volumes and fluid flows are reconstructed jointly in a higher space-time dimension, enabling faster convergence and better reconstruction quality of both fluid flow and particle volumes within a few minutes on modern GPUs. Synthetic and experimental results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed technique. <a href='https://ni-chen.github.io/HoloFlow-PTV/'>Project page</a>"

  summary: "Model-based 3D holographic imaging: Gabor holography is a simple and effective approach for 3D imaging. However, it suffers from a DC term, twin-image entanglement, and defocus noise. The conventional approach for solving this problem is either using an off-axis setup, or compressive holography. The former sacrifices simplicity, and the latter is computationally demanding and time consuming. To cope with this problem, we propose a model-based holographic network (MB-HoloNet) for 3D particle imaging. The free-space point spread function, which is essential for hologram reconstruction, is used as a prior in the MB-HoloNet. All parameters are learned end-to-end. The physical prior makes the network efficient and stable for both localization and 3D particle size reconstructions. <a href='https://ni-chen.github.io/3D-MB-HoloNet/'>Project page</a>"
